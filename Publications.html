		 The goal of human brain mapping has long been to delineate the functional subunits in the brain and elucidate the functional role of each of these brain regions. Recent work has focused on whole-brain parcellation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to identify these subunits and create a functional atlas. Functional connectivity approaches to understand the brain at the network level require such an atlas to assess connections between parcels and extract network properties. While no single functional atlas has emerged as the dominant atlas to date, there remains an underlying assumption that such an atlas exists. Using fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional parcellations based on fMRI connectivity data reconfigure substantially and in a meaningful manner, according to brain state.

		  There is extensive evidence that human brain functional organization is dynamic, varying within a subject as the brain switches between tasks demands. This functional organization also varies across subjects, even when they are all engaged in similar tasks. Currently, we lack a comprehensive model that unifies the two dimensions of variation (brain state and subject). Using fMRI data obtained across multiple task-evoked and rest conditions (which we operationally define as brain states) and across multiple subjects, we develop a state- and subject-specific functional network parcellation (the assignment of nodes to networks). Our parcellation approach provides a measure of how node-to-network assignment (NNA) changes across states and across subjects. We demonstrate that the brain's functional networks are not spatially fixed, but reconfigure with brain state. This reconfiguration is robust and reliable to such an extent that it can be used to predict brain state with accuracies up to 97%. [ Code:

		  Recent work with functional connectivity data has led to significant progress in understanding the functional organization of the brain. While the majority of the literature has focused on group-level parcellation approaches, there is ample evidence that the brain varies in both structure and function across individuals. In this work, we introduce a parcellation technique that incorporates delineation of functional networks both at the individual- and group-level. The proposed technique deploys the notion of "submodularity" to jointly parcellate the cerebral cortex while establishing an inclusive correspondence between the individualized functional networks. Using this parcellation technique, we successfully establish a cross-validated predictive model that predicts individuals' sex, solely based on the parcellation schemes (i.e. the node-to-network assignment vectors). The sex prediction finding illustrates that individualized parcellation of functional networks can reveal subgroups in a population and suggests that the use of a global network parcellation may overlook fundamental differences in network organization. This is a particularly important point to consider in studies comparing patients versus controls or even patient subgroups. This approach to the individualized study of functional organization in the brain has many implications for both neuroscience and clinical applications. [ Code:

		  Clinically approved antidepressants modulate the brain's emotional valence circuits, suggesting that the response of these circuits could serve as a biomarker for screening candidate antidepressant drugs. However, it is necessary that these modulations can be reliably detected. Here, we apply a cross-validated predictive model to classify emotional valence and pharmacologic effect across eleven task-based fMRI datasets (n = 306) exploring the effect of antidepressant administration on emotional face processing.

		  Recent studies on functional neuroimaging (e.g. fMRI) attempt to model the brain as a network. A conventional functional connectivity approach for defining nodes in the network is grouping similar voxels together, a method known as functional parcellation. The majority of previous work on human brain parcellation employs a group-level analysis by collapsing data from the entire population. However, these methods ignore the large amount of inter-individual variability and uniqueness in connectivity. This is particularly relevant for patient studies or even developmental studies where a single functional atlas may not be appropriate for all individuals or conditions. To account for the individual differences, we developed an approach to individualized parcellation. The algorithm starts with an initial group-level parcellation and forms the individualized ones using a local exemplar-based submodular clustering method. The utility of individualized parcellations is further demonstrated through improvement in the accuracy of a predictive model that predicts IQ using functional connectome. [ Code:
